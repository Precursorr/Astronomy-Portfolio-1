# Astronomy
## Intro
<br>
The Astronomy page is an information hub that will be expanded in the future. As of now, people can come to this website and read some interesting facts about the solar system and universe us humans reside in. People who have a broad interest in astronomy can find something here that will catch their eye.

People can simply browse the website of their own accord and if they like whaht they see, can sign up for a weekly newsletting as well as join group astronomy outtings.
## Responsiveness

## Testing
<br>
1. Tested to confirm the website works on all major platforms, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge.
2. Tested responsiveness of the site on different screen sizes. Responsiveness was good however tweaks could be made for user experence improvements
3. Lighthouse testing can be hit and miss in regards to performance depending on internet connection and due to the large number of pictures its hard to speed this up. All images that yeilded a lower file size when converted from jpg to webp were used.
4. CSS W3C jigsaw validator found no faults.
5. HTML W3C validator found no faults

## Deployment
<br>
To deploy the project I followed these steps starting from the main project repository [here](https://github.com/Precursorr/Astronomy-Portfolio-1).

 1. On the navigation bar I clicked `settings`.
 2. From there I selected `pages`.
 3. From there I selected the `main` option in the dropdown menu within the `build and deployment` section.
 4. I Selected `save` after this, not touching any other options. After a few moment of waiting I clicked the link to view my page in real time.
