                    On July 8, 2003, the Oppertunity Rover launched from Earth and 7 months later, landed on Mars.
                    'Oppy' as
                    she was nicknamed was only supposed to last 90 days on mission. Instead, She explored
                    Mars for 15 years and travelled 45 km, the longest mars mission ever from one that was supposed to
                    be
                    the shortest. Unfortunately and on Feb. 13, 2019 she suffered critical malfunctions, the NASA
                    mission
                    control overseeing Oppy tried everything they could to fix her but to no avail. The team sent one
                    last
                    transmission, the song 'I'll be seeing you' as a goodbye. Oppy's last message? 'My battery is low
                    and
                    it's getting dark.'

                    The Universe is estimated to be almost 14 billion years old, with around 90 billion light years
                    visable to us - two numbers truely incomprehenseable to us. If you were to study all the information
                    about the universe, a lifetime would not be enough to cover anything. Instead here are some general
                    facts that might just blow your mind.
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are more stars in the Universe then there are grains of sand on Earth.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>At the heart of every Galaxy is a 'Supermassive Black Hole' The Milky Way Black Hole has an
                        estimated 4.3 million solar masses - that is, 4.3 million times as massive as our sun. The
                        largest known Black Hole, Ton 618, has an estimated 66 billion solar masses.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If we wanted the Earth to become a Black Hole, we would need to squash everything down to the
                        size of a pea nut.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The hardest theoredical material is nuclear pasta, and can only be found in the second most
                        violent celestial object, the core of a Neutron star. Here the gravity is so strong that
                        electrons are ripped away from atoms and you end up with proton and neutron 'pasta'.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>When a star dies, it has the potential to go supernova. The final element is silicone to iron,
                        and because iron cannot be broken into another element and therefore cannot be used as fuel.
                        Eventually the fuel gets so low that the radiation pushing the star outwards cannot overcome the
                        gravity pushing inwards. The core collaspses in on itself at 25% the speed of ligth. Either a
                        neutron star will be born, or a Black hole will form. This is how nebulas form too!</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Nebulas are giant gas clouds of beauty spanning many light years across. Some will be shown at
                        the bottom of the page.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Most stars we see in the right sky are already dead. The reason we see them is because space is
                        so vast that even the speed of light seems slow. The death event of that star is yet to reach
                        our eyes. When we look up at night, we are in fact looking into the past of the Universe</li>
