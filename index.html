                    understand and hopefully one day travel with such ease that communicating over the years is as

                        We succeeded in taking that picture [from deep space], and, if you look at it, you see a dot.
                        That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who
                        ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of
                        confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and
                        coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and peasant, every young couple
                        in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every
                        teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint
                        and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.

                        On July 8, 2003, the Opportunity Rover launched from Earth and 7 months later, landed on Mars.
                        'Oppy', as she was nicknamed, was only supposed to last 90 days on mission. Instead, she
                        explored Mars for 15 years and traveled 45 km—the longest Mars mission ever—from one that was
                        supposed to be the shortest. Unfortunately, on February 13, 2019, she suffered critical
                        malfunctions. The NASA mission control overseeing Oppy tried everything they could to fix her,
                        but to no avail. The team sent one last transmission, the song 'I'll be seeing you', as a
                        goodbye. Oppy's last message? 'My battery is low, and it's getting dark.'

                        The universe is estimated to be almost 14 billion years old, with around 90 billion light years
                        visible to us—two numbers truly incomprehensible to us. If you were to study all the information
                        about the universe, a lifetime would not be enough to cover everything. Instead, here are some
                        general facts that might just blow your mind.
                    </p>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>There are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on Earth.</li>

                            At the heart of every galaxy is a 'Supermassive Black Hole' The Milky Way Black Hole has an
                            estimated 4.3 million solar masses—that is, 4.3 million times as massive as our sun. The
                            largest known black hole, Ton 618, has an estimated 66 billion solar masses.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If we wanted the Earth to become a black hole, we would need to squash everything down to
                            the size of a pea nut.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The hardest theoretical material is nuclear pasta, which can only be found in the second
                            most violent celestial object, the core of a neutron star. Here, gravity is so strong that
                            electrons are ripped away from atoms, and you end up with proton and neutron 'pasta'.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When a star dies, it has the potential to go supernova. The final element conversion is
                            silicone to iron, because iron cannot be broken into another element and therefore cannot be
                            used as fuel. Eventually, the fuel gets so low that the radiation pushing the star outward
                            cannot overcome the gravity pushing inward. The core collapses in on itself at 25% the speed
                            of light. Either a neutron star will be born or a black hole will form. This is how nebulae
                            form too!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Nebulas are giant gas clouds of beauty spanning many light years across.

                            Most stars we see in the right sky are already dead. The reason we see them is because
                            space is so vast that even the speed of light seems slow. The death event of that star is
                            yet to reach our eyes. When we look up at night, we are in fact looking into the past of the
                            universe.
