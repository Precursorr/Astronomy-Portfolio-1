                            The sun is a G-type star, or yellow dwarf, as they're more commonly known. It was formed
                            from the collection of a huge nitrogen gas cloud that collasped in on itself, eventually
                            triggering fusion and lighting up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sun makes up 99.8% of all mass in the solar system, has an inner core temperature of 15
                            million degrees Celsius, and is almost 1.4 billion km wide.

                            Earth is the third planet in the solar system, is 150 million km away from our sun, and is
                            considered to be in the Goldilocks zone, the position a planet can be in around a star that
                            allows life to thrive.

                            Our little blue rock is over 4.5 billion years old and has sustained life for more than half
                            that time. We are merely specks on this impossible-to-imagine timescale.

                            The Moon is Earth's celestial satellite that orbits our planet every 28 days and is
                            tidal-locked, meaning the same side always faces the planet. This is due to it's axis
                            rotation and orbit around the Earth matching.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's said that the moon formed when two Mars-sized planets smashed into each other. The end
                            result was Earth and its moon.

                            Being so close, it's impossible for life to form here, as temperatures range from 430
                            degrees Celsius during the day to minus 180 degrees Celsius during the night.

                            Venus is the second planet in the solar system, and much like Mercury, it is too close to
                            the sun to sustain life, but despite being 108 million km away from the sun, Venus is
                            actually hotter.

                            harbored life and could possibly do so again with terraforming efforts.

                            as well as the rest of the planets. Jupiter is considered a failed star as its composition

                            orbiting ring. Saturn's rings are thought to have evolved from the debris of two icy moons
                            that collided and shattered a few hundred million years ago.
