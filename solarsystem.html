                    <p>The Sun is G-type star, or yellow dwarf as they're more commonly known as. It was formed from the collection of a huge nitrogen gas cloud that collasped in on itself, eventually triggering fusion and lighting up. </p>
                    <p>The Sun makes up 99.8% of all mass in the solar system, has an inner core temperature of 15 million degrees Celsius and is almost 1.4 billion KM wide.</p>

                    <p>Earth is the third planet in the solar system, is 150 million KM away from our sun and is
                        considered to be in the goldilocks zone, the position a planet can be around a star that allows
                        life to thrive.</p>
                    <p>Our little blue rock is over 4.5 billion years old and has sustained life for more then half that
                        time. We are merely a speck on it's impossible to imagine timescale.</p>

                    <p>The Moon is Earth's celestial satellite that orbits our planet ever 28 days. The Moon is tidal
                        locked meaning the same side always faces the planet. This is due to it's axis rotation and
                        orbit around the Earth matching.</p>
                    <p>It's said that the Moon formed when two Mars sized planets smashed into each other. The end
                        result was Earth and the Moon.</p>

                        close, it's impossible for life to form here as temperatures range from 430 degrees Celsius
                        during the day and minus 180 degrees Celsius during the night.</p>

                        sustain life. Dispite it's 108 million KM distance away from the Sun, Venus is actually hotter
                        than Merury.</p>

                        orbiting ring. Saturn's rings are thought to have evolved from the debris of two icy moons that
                        collided and shattered a few hundred million years ago.</p>
